This is a basic concept art for a dungeon crawler.
Its writen only in rust.
It uses ratatui to draw the front end in the terminal
and postgres as a DB to store diffrent kinds of weapons, artifacts and equipment.
Feel free to download and try..
I am very Lazy so there are some bugs and you need to setup the DB yourself,
but all the querys for the tables are in the dbpaths.rs File
